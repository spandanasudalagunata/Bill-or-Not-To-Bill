Bill Or Not To Bill



The goal for the project was to build a predictive model that can predict if a particular work order (free form text) was billable or not for a private company located in North Canton, OH.

•	Built a deep learning network model to identify billable and non-billable calls and services 
•	Examined the variables and performed data transformation and imputation of missing values.
•	Recoded the transformation of variables to tensors to build the model.
•	Divided the data into train, test and validation set and tuned in the hyperparameters to obtain better results.
